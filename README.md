# OTP-Verification-System
Developed an OTP (One-Time Password) verification system in Python. The system generates a 6-digit OTP and sends it to the user's email address for verification. Upon receiving the OTP, the user should enter it into the system for validation. If the entered OTP matches the generated OTP, access will be granted; otherwise, access will be denied.
